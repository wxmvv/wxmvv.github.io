# Newspaper Style Design

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/silkine/pen/QWBxVX](https://codepen.io/silkine/pen/QWBxVX).

Just experimenting a bit around with what you can do with webfonts and ligatures and only two font families: Playfair (Google Webfont) and Droid Serif (Google Webfont). Trying to find that one or two tweaks to make the design feel newspapery.
